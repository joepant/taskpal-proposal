        <p>Task Pal will be a convenient task tracking app storing things to do, notes on the task, and status of completion.</p>
        <p>I'll be using HTML/CSS/JS, Node.js, Azure, and MongoDB</p>

            <li>Use MongoDB to store tasks</li>
            <li>Host on Azure with GitHub and Node</li>

            <li>Front end: use HTML/CSS and JavaScript to create a smooth front end</li>
            <li>Cloud hosting and CI/CD: use the same workflow as most of our projects in class, leveraging Azure and GitHub</li>
            <li>MongoDB: although we haven’t covered this quite yet, I looked ahead to see if we’d be doing any database work and chose based on the syllabus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Advanced technical features:</p>
        <ul>
